# Big Band Jazz

## Step 1
The Jazz musician lost his trumpet and has been playing the kazoo. Use the Agent to get through the maze and collect the trumpet to help restore history!


#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use ``||agent.agent move||`` to get through the maze and ``||agent.agent collect all||`` to pick up the trumpet.

```ghost
    agent.move(FORWARD, 0)
    agent.collectAll()
```
```template

```
```package
```
