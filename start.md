# Power the Timeline

## Step 1
Welcome to your first coding task. We must re-connect the power to the timeline. Use blocks from the TOOLBOX to move your Agent FORWARD to the red block.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
DRAG the ``||agent.agent move||`` block to the ``||blocks.on start||`` block and change the number from 1 to 3. To play your code, press the GREEN PLAY BUTTON.

```ghost
    agent.move(FORWARD, 0)
```
```template
\\
```
```package
```
