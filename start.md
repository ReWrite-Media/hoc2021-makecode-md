## Step 1
Welcome to your first coding task. You will use blocks from the TOOLBOX below to move your AGENT. DRAG the ``||agent.agent move||`` block to the ``||blocks.on start||`` block in the code window. Change the number 1 to number 3, so that your AGENT will move FORWARD the right number of steps. Press the GREEN PLAY BUTTON in the bottom right-hand corner of the code window to RUN YOUR CODE.



```ghost
    agent.move(FORWARD, 0)
